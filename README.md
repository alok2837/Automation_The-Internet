# Test Automation for the-internet.herokuapp.com
This project contains automation tests written in Java using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG for the website the-internet.herokuapp.com. The purpose of these tests is to improve your test automation skills and demonstrate how to automate different scenarios on the website.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

```
|-- src
|   |-- main
|   |   |-- java
|   |   |   |-- pages
|               |-- HomePage.java
|               |-- LoginPage.java
|               |-- ...
|   |   |-- resources
|   |
|   |-- test
|       |-- java
|           |-- base
|               |-- BaseTests.java
|           |-- login
|               |-- LoginTests.java
|           |-- ...
|       |-- resources
|
|-- .gitignore
|-- pom.xml
|-- README.md
```

- The src directory contains the main source code and test code.
- The src/main/java directory is where you can place any utility classes framework or page object model classes.
- The src/test/java directory contains the test classes where you'll write your test cases.
- The src/test/resources directory is where you can store any test-specific resources, such as test data files or configuration files.
- The src/test/resources/testng.xml file is the TestNG configuration file where you can configure your test suites, test groups, and other settings.
- The .gitignore file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git version control.

## Prerequisites
To run the automation tests in this project, you'll need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 10 or higher
- Apache Maven
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG


## Running the Tests
Follow these steps to run the automation tests:

- Clone the repository to your local machine: $ git clone <repository-url>
- Navigate to the project directory: $ cd project-directory
- Build the project using Maven: $ mvn clean install
- Execute the tests using the TestNG runner: $ mvn test
##Writing Test Cases
To create new test cases or modify existing ones, follow these guidelines:

- Create a new Java class under src/test/java/ or add your test cases to an existing class.
- Use the TestNG annotations (@Test, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, etc.) to define your test methods and set up/tear down steps.
- Leverage Selenium WebDriver API to interact with the web elements on the website under test.
- Implement assertions to verify the expected outcomes of your test cases.
  
## Continuous Integration
You can integrate this project with any Continuous Integration (CI) tool of your choice, such as Jenkins or Travis CI. Set up a CI pipeline to automatically build and execute the tests on each commit or at specific intervals.
